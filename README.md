### Where to Use
You can use this app by clicking <a href="https://johnf008.github.io/Pomodoro_Pet/" target="_blank">HERE</a>

### How to Use
You can begin the pomdoro timer by clicking the start button. When the time is up, a meow sound effect will play, which signals the start of a break. Press start on the timer, and come back when the meowing starts again. Thsi works like a regular Pomodoro timer, but each time you lock in, you level up!
